    <p class = "sub-title" style="font-size:2em;">  A hospital is a health care institution providing
      patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing
      staff and medical equipment. The best-known type of
      hospital is the general hospital, which typically
      has an emergency department to treat urgent health
      problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a
      heart attack.</p>
